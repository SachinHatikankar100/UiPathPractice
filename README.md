# UiPathPractice
UiPath Practice .xaml file goes here

Hey there, Welcome to my Advance UiPath knowledge Repository.
Feel free to explore the xamls and enhance your knowledge in UiPath
Usage: Test.xlsx as your input file and start running the xaml individually and explore the working logic without any external dependency
This is created to remove the distraction of making input file and wasting time in setting up the xamls.
By making this repository I wish to save your time and help you learn things quickly which will be helpful for the next technical feasibility which is on your way which you are dreading about. Don't worry I have got your back :)
